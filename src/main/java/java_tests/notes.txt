ArrayList is an ordered collection, and it maintains the insertion order.

A method-local inner class can be abstract

X run = new X(); Thread t = new Thread(run); t.start();

If a switch block has no default, adding an assert default is considered appropriate.

An anonymous inner class can extend exactly one class or implement exactly one interface.

The notifyAll() method must be called from a synchronized context.
